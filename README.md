# Tetris
The application allows users to play the classic game tetris. Players can strategically place different shaped blocks on a grid as they fall to the bottom to clear 
levels. The puzzle game allows players to figure out how to place the blocks so that there are not any gaps so they can gain points.

To play the game, you must download eight files which are the ConfigurePage.py, GamePage.py, StartupPage.py, TopscorePage.py, main.py, TetrisLogo.png, background.wav, 
and can_rotate.wav. Once everything is download start at main.py and run the program.

Once the program is running, the startup page window will pop up on your screen. The startup page has four buttons. If you click the exit button, it will end the 
entire program and close the window. If you click the Configure button, it will take you to the confirure page where you can configure the game how you would like.
You can choose the size of the field, game level, normal or extended game(the normal game includes seven different blocks with four squares and the extended game
includes two more blocks with three squares), and player or Ai mode (player mode is when the player uses the keyboard to control the falling blocks and AI mode is when
the game's artificial intelligence controls the falling blocks) by clicking the button in the preferred setting. The configure page also includes a close button if you 
would like to end the program and a back button if you would like to go back to the startup page. On the startup page, if you click the scores button, it will take you 
to the topscore page. The topscore page displays the top ten best scores of the user. The topscore page also includes an exit button so the user can end the program and 
a back button to take the user back to the startup page. On the startup page, if the user clicks the start button, the gamepage will pop up on the window. On the 
gamepage, a game field is displayed where the player will see the falling blocks and be able to place it at the bottom of the field. The gamepage also shows the user 
the current score of the session, the number of lines the user eliminated in the session, the user's current level, the type of game the user is playing (extended or 
normal), the mode the user is playing (player or Ai), and the shape of the next block that falls to the bottom of the field. To move the blocks  the user can press the 
left arrow key to shift the block to the left, right arrow key to shift to the right, up arrow key to rotate the block 90 degrees clockwise, and the down arrow key to 
increase the falling speed of the block. The 'P' key pauses and resumes the game, the 'M' key turns the sound effect on or off, the 'esc' key makes a pop up dialog box 
appear and ask the user if they want to end the game, Saying 'yes' will bring the user back to the startup page and 'no' will let the user continue playing. To gain 
points, the player must elimiate lines with one block drop; one line equals one hundred points, two lines equals three hundred points, three lines equals six hundred
points, and four lines equals one thousand points. The game ends when the field is filled with blocks and there is no more space for anymore falling blocks or if the 
player decides to end the game.
